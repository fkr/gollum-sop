# Gollum-SOP

Gollum-SOP is an opinionated setup of [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum) in order
to provide a lean and simple way of documenting [Standard Operating Procedures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure) (SOPs).

Gollum-SOP bundles [gollum-auth](https://github.com/bjoernalbers/gollum-auth) with a custom
patch to make it working with Gollum version 6. Furthermore some custom additions are
added through `config.ru`.
